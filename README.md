# 🌐 kuba.lol
[kuba.lol](https://kuba.lol) is my personal website with many awesome features. It has HUGE amount of references to other titles (and there will be even more later in time), HUGE amount of secrets and I'm going to keep this site updated as long as I possibly can!
## ⚙ Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Tested on v20.9.0+)
- npm (or any other working package manager/tested on npm v10.2.5+)
## 🔧 Instalation
Download source code using *Code* button in corner of file viewer and install required packages using:
```bash
$ npm install
```
## 🧱 Building
If you want to build the website so it will be ready for release just type:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
and for preview of it:
```bash
$ npm run preview
```
## 💻 Dev Testing
If you want to introduce some neat pull request for website, it would be nice to test it first! That's why here's Vite's dev testing option under:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
...which will allow you to do hot reloads of website!
